/**
 * The root cause of this bug is in `InferReactiveScopeVariables`. Currently,
 * InferReactiveScopeVariables do not ensure that maybe-aliased values get
 * assigned the same reactive scope. This is safe only when an already-
 * constructed value is captured, e.g.
 * ```js
 * const x = makeObj();  ⌝ mutable range of x
 * mutate(x);            ⌟
 *                       <-- after this point, we can produce a canonical version
 *                           of x for all following aliases
 * const y = [];
 * y.push(x);            <-- y captures x
 * ```
 *
 * However, if a value is captured/aliased during its mutable range and the
 * capturing container is separately memoized, it becomes difficult to guarantee
 * that all aliases refer to the same value.
 *
 * Sprout error:
 * Found differences in evaluator results
 * Non-forget (expected):
 * (kind: ok) [{"wat0":"joe"},3]
 * [{"wat0":"joe"},3]
 * Forget:
 * (kind: ok) [{"wat0":"joe"},3]
 * [[ (exception in render) Error: oh no! ]]
