 * Exposes bug involving iife inlining + codegen.
 * We currently inline iifes to labeled blocks (not value-blocks).
 *
 * Here, print(1) and the evaluation of makeArray(...) get the same scope
 * as the compiler infers that the makeArray call may mutate its arguments.
 * Since print(1) does not get its own scope (and is thus not a declaration
 * or dependency), it does not get promoted.
 * As a result, print(1) gets reordered across the labeled-block instructions
 * to be inlined at the makeArray callsite.
 *
 * Current evaluator results:
 *   Found differences in evaluator results
 *   Non-forget (expected):
 *   (kind: ok) [null,2]
 *   logs: [1,2]
 *   Forget:
 *   (kind: ok) [null,2]
 *   logs: [2,1]
