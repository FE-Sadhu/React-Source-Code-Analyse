/**
 * This fixture tests what happens when a reactive has no declarations (other than an early return),
 * no reassignments, and no dependencies. In this case the only thing we can use to decide if we
 * should take the if or else branch is the early return declaration. But if that uses the same
 * sentinel as the memo cache sentinel, then if the previous execution did not early return it will
 * look like we didn't execute the memo block yet, and we'll needlessly re-execute instead of skipping
 * to the else branch.
 *
 * We have to use a distinct sentinel for the early return value.
 *
 * Here the fixture will always take the "else" branch and never early return. Logging (not included)
 * confirms that the scope for `x` only executes once, on the first render of the component.
