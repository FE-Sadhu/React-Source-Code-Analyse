/**
 * In this example, the `<Stringify ... />` JSX block mutates then captures obj.
 * As JSX expressions freeze their values, we know that `obj` and `myDiv` cannot
 * be mutated past this.
 * This set of mutable range + scopes is an edge case because the JSX expression
 * references values in two scopes.
 * - (freeze) the result of `mutateAndReturn`
 *   this is a mutable value with a mutable range starting at `makeObject()`
 * - (mutate) the lvalue storing the result of `<Stringify .../>`
 *   this is a immutable value and so gets assigned a different scope
 *
 * obj@0 = makeObj();                        ⌝ scope@0
 * if (cond) {                               |
 *   $1@0 = mutate(obj@0);                   |
 *   myDiv@1 = JSX $1@0          <- scope@1  |
 * }                                         ⌟
 *
 * Coincidentally, the range of `obj` is extended by alignScopesToBlocks to *past*
 * the end of the JSX instruction. As we currently alias identifier mutableRanges to
 * scope ranges, this `freeze` reference is perceived as occurring during the mutable
 * range of `obj` (even though it is after the last mutating reference).
 *
 * This case is technically safe as `myDiv` correctly takes `obj` as a dependency. As
 * a result, developers can never observe myDiv can aliasing a different value generation
 * than `obj` (e.g. the invariant `myDiv.props.value === obj` always holds).
