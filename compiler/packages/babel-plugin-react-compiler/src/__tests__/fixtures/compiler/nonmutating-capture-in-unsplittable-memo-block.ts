 * Currently, InferReactiveScopeVariables do not ensure that maybe-aliased

 * ```js
 * const x = makeObj();  ⌝ mutable range of x
 * mutate(x);            ⌟
 *                       <-- after this point, we can produce a canonical version
 *                           of x for all following aliases
 * const y = [];
 * y.push(x);            <-- y captures x
 * ```
 *
 * However, if a value is captured/aliased during its mutable range and the
 * capturing container is separately memoized, it becomes difficult to guarantee
 * that all aliases refer to the same value.
