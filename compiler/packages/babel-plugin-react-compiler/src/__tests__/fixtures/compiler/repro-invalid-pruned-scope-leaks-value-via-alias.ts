 * Here, `z`'s original memo block is removed due to the inner hook call.
 * However, we also infer that `z` is non-reactive, so by default we would create
 * the memo block for `thing = [y, z]` as only depending on `y`.
 *
 * This could then mean that `thing[1]` and `z` may not refer to the same value,
 * since z recreates every time but `thing` doesn't correspondingly invalidate.
 *
 * The fix is to consider pruned memo block outputs as reactive, since they will
 * recreate on every render. This means `thing` depends on both y and z.
