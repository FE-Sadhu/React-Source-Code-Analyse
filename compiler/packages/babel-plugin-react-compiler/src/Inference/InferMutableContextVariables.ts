/*
 * This pass infers which of the given function's context (free) variables
 * are definitively mutated by the function. This analysis is *partial*,
 * and only annotates provable mutations, and may miss mutations via indirections.
 * The intent of this pass is to drive validations, rejecting known-bad code
 * while avoiding false negatives, and the inference should *not* be used to
 * drive changes in output.
 *
 * Note that a complete analysis is possible but would have too many false negatives.
 * The approach would be to run LeaveSSA and InferReactiveScopeVariables in order to
 * find all possible aliases of a context variable which may be mutated. However, this
 * can lead to false negatives:
 *
 * ```
 * const [x, setX] = useState(null); // x is frozen
 * const fn = () => { // context=[x]
 *    const z = {}; // z is mutable
 *    foo(z, x); // potentially mutate z and x
 *    z.a = true; // definitively mutate z
 * }
 * fn();
 * ```
 *
 * When we analyze function expressions we assume that context variables are mutable,
 * so we assume that `x` is mutable. We infer that `foo(z, x)` could be mutating the
 * two variables to alias each other, such that `z.a = true` could be mutating `x`,
 * and we would infer that `x` is definitively mutated. Then when we run
 * InferReferenceEffects on the outer code we'd reject it, since there is a definitive
 * mutation of a frozen value.
 *
 * Thus the actual implementation looks at only basic aliasing. The above example would
 * pass, since z does not directly alias `x`. However, mutations through trivial aliases
 * are detected:
 *
 * ```
 * const [x, setX] = useState(null); // x is frozen
 * const fn = () => { // context=[x]
 *    const z = x;
 *    z.a = true; // ERROR: mutates x
 * }
 * fn();
 * ```
